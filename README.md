## Installation

```bash
npm install @inventsable/panelify
```

## Simple usage

> Will do write up on iframe contents later

```html
<template>
  <panelify extName="test" appName="AEFT" />
</template>

<script>
  // Must explicitly import the panelify element (and conversely import the shim in your iframe environment)
  import { panelify } from "@/components/panelify";

  export default {
    name: "home",
    components: {
      panelify
    }
  };
</script>
```
